# hitstorm

An application where you can express your feelings towards the latest topics.

I built this application during Quarinitine and had a lot of fun with it. It lets you post Quests that can be then voted and commented by other users. The app is fully functional and has shortly been available through Testflight (Apple's Beta Launcher). During this time it had a couple hundred users and ,to my suprise, 10 in China.

The app works with a backend that uses the Goolge Cloud Platform through Firebase. It contains several Google Analytics events.
